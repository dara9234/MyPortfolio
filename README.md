`Updating My Portfolio`

This portfolio showcase my personality, my education and most of the projects I have done which show my employer ready skills! My focus was to make the portfolio moile-responsive while designing.

My most favorite projects are pinned to the Github and also the links are provided in my portfolio page.

To bulild my portfolio, I have used HTML/CSS and bootstrap to make it more structured and standout. The portfilo was deployed to Github pages.

Am always looking for positive reinforcement from you all!
